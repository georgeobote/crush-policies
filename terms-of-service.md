# Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2025-11-21_

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of Crush, the college-only dating experience operated by Swag Labs, Inc. By creating an account, accessing the app, or participating in any feature (SMS login, `.edu` verification, swipe decks, matches, chat, Crush Drop scheduler, etc.), you agree to these Terms. If you disagree, do not use the service.

## 1. Eligibility & Accounts

1. You must be at least 18 years old, currently enrolled at an accredited college or university, and able to verify a valid `.edu` email address.
2. You must provide accurate registration information and keep it up to date (display name, phone number, `.edu` email, school, graduation year, etc.).
3. Each user may maintain one account. You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and device. Notify us immediately of unauthorized use.

## 2. Verification & Access

1. We require both SMS verification and `.edu` email confirmation before unlocking discovery features.
2. We may suspend or terminate access if we cannot verify eligibility, suspect fraud, or detect policy violations.
3. Crush Drop, swipe feeds, and messaging depend on a compliant profile (minimum three approved photos, verified phone/.edu, complete profile fields).

## 3. License & Acceptable Use

1. We grant you a revocable, non-transferable license to use the app for personal, non-commercial purposes.
2. You agree not to:  
   - Misrepresent identity, age, school affiliation, or intent.  
   - Upload unlawful, discriminatory, or sexually explicit content.  
   - Harass, stalk, threaten, spam, or otherwise abuse users.  
   - Attempt to scrape, reverse engineer, or bypass technical protections.  
   - Use the service for advertising, pyramid schemes, or solicitation.
3. We may remove content, limit visibility, or terminate accounts for violations without prior notice.

## 4. User Content

1. You retain ownership of content you submit (photos, bios, messages) but grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to host, reproduce, modify, and display it solely to operate the service.
2. You represent that you have rights to the content and that it does not infringe third-party rights.
3. Some content (profiles, matches, messages) is shared with other users consistent with our Privacy Policy and Firestore security rules.

## 5. Safety & Reporting

1. Use the in-app safety tools to block or report users who violate these Terms. Blocks are mutual and remove visibility in swipes/matches.
2. Reports may trigger limited disclosure to trust & safety personnel and, when required, law enforcement.
3. We do not guarantee compatibility or personal safety; meet others responsibly and follow local guidance.

## 6. Crush Drops, Intelligent Matching & Notifications

1. Crush Drop is the primary discovery surface. Our intelligent matcher evaluates opted-in students three times per day in their school time zone, prioritizing campus matches before widening to statewide/nationwide options when necessary. Scoring considers items you add to your profile (major, clubs, Greek-life participation, activity recency, location scope). You can toggle participation and adjust scopes in Settings → Discovery.
2. Each drop requires double opt-in. Both participants must tap Interested before chat unlocks, and the app may surface spotlight-style reveals or reminders when a drop is ready.
3. We may send push notifications or emails for drops, matches, messages, and service updates. You control these settings via the app and OS-level controls.

## 7. Paid Features

The current release does not include paid subscriptions or in-app purchases. If we introduce paid features, we will update these Terms and communicate pricing in-app.

## 8. Termination

1. You may delete your account at any time from Settings → Safety & privacy. This triggers the backend deletion workflow documented in the repository.
2. We may suspend or terminate your account for any violation of these Terms, suspected fraud, or to protect community safety. We are not liable for resulting losses.

## 9. Disclaimers

1. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
2. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY MATCHES, RELATIONSHIPS, OR OUTCOMES, NOR DO WE VET USERS BEYOND `.EDU` VERIFICATION AND CONTENT MODERATION.
3. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the service is limited to USD $100 or the amount you paid for the service in the past 12 months, whichever is greater.

## 11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Crush, its affiliates, and employees from any claims arising out of your content, conduct, or breach of these Terms.

## 12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute shall be resolved in state or federal courts located in Fort Bend County, Texas, unless otherwise required by law.

## 13. Changes

We may update these Terms to reflect product changes, legal requirements, or new features. We will notify you via in-app notice or email, and your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
